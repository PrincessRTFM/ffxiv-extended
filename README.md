# FFXIV: Extended

This collection of guides is intended to help beginners with setting up a variety of extensions to _Final Fantasy XIV_. It originated as a setup guide for XIVLauncher and Penumbra, and has since expanded to include additional content.

At the time of this writing, these guides are still being written. However, even once finished, _all_ guides will continue to be updated with reader feedback and changes to the content they cover.

# FAQ

## Which guide do I want?

- [Setting up XIVLauncher, in-game plugins, and texture mods with Penumbra](/plugins-and-mods.md)
- [My personal plugin recommendations](/plugin-recs.md)

There's also a new section that's not actually about any third-party tools at all, just things in the game itself that are poorly (or, more often, _not_) explained.
- [Things XIV doesn't tell you](/tips.md)

## Are these things allowed?

That's a bit of a complicated matter. The super-short answer is "no" - third party tools are forbidden by the ToS. That includes plugins, mods, parsers, and anything that affects _or observes_ the game's memory and network communication to the server, like Teamcraft.

The slightly-longer answer is "no, _but_..." - Square Enix has admitted that they don't have the means in place to monitor for such things, and that doing so would actually be a violation of multiple privacy laws. They can't tell if you're doing that kind of thing unless you outright tell them you are.

The full answer, then, is something like this:

> All third-party tools and modifications are against the official ToS, _but_ as long as you don't mention them on official channels or use them to harass (or _enable_ harassment of) other players, not only does SE not know, they also _don't actually care_.

While I wouldn't advise publicly streaming a modded game or the use of plugins, and you should _never_ talk about using third party tools on official channels, it's perfectly safe to use them and discuss them with your friends.

Or even to write a collection of guides on github to help beginners get started with them.

## I found a mistake/typo/etc!

Let me know and I'll see about fixing it! These guides are still live and being improved with feedback from readers.

## This isn't very clear, I don't understand what you're saying!

Same as above: let me know and I'll see what I can do to fix it.

## Can you write a guide for \_\_\_\_\_?

Probably! Let me know what you're looking for and I'll see what I can do.

## How much work did all this take?

More that is visible, given changes and rewrites and fixing up outdated details. Feel like helping a girl out?
