# FFXIV: Extended

This collection of guides is intended to help beginners with setting up a variety of extensions to _Final Fantasy XIV_. It originated as a setup guide for XIVLauncher and Penumbra, and has since expanded to include additional content.

At the time of this writing, these guides are still being written. However, even once finished, _all_ guides will continue to be updated with reader feedback and changes to the content they cover.

## Which guide do I want?

- [Setting up XIVLauncher, in-game plugins, and texture mods with Penumbra](/plugins-and-mods.md)
- [My personal plugin recommendations](/plugin-recs.md)
- [Penumbra mod metadata and how to edit it](/penumbra-metadata.md)
- [ConceptMatrix and posing](/cmtool.md)

## I found a mistake/typo/etc!

Let me know and I'll see about fixing it! These guides are still live and being improved with feedback from readers.

## This isn't very clear, I don't understand what you're saying!

Same as above: let me know and I'll see what I can do to fix it.

## Can you write a guide for \_\_\_\_\_?

Probably! Let me know what you're looking for and I'll see what I can do.
